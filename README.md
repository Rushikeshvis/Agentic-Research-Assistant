# AI Research Agent

[cite_start]*This project was developed for the IBM Hackathon.* 

## 📝 Project Description

[cite_start]An AI system designed to assist with academic and scientific research tasks. [cite_start]This agent uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to help researchers, students, and professionals stay updated with the rapidly growing volume of academic publications[cite: 17, 19]. [cite_start]It automates repetitive tasks like citation management and data extraction, enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and innovation in R&D[cite: 51, 52].

## 🎯 The Challenge

[cite_start]Researchers, students, and professionals often struggle to stay updated with the vast volume of academic publications, technical articles, and evolving research trends[cite: 17]. [cite_start]Manually reviewing, filtering, and synthesizing this information is time-consuming and inefficient[cite: 18].

## ✨ Key Features

[cite_start]This agent significantly reduces research time and improves the quality of literature reviews by offering:

* [cite_start]**Semantic Search:** Conducts searches across research papers, journals, and datasets[cite: 33].
* [cite_start]**Auto-Summarization:** Automatically generates summaries of selected papers[cite: 34].
* [cite_start]**Citation Analysis:** Traces influence and connections through citation and reference analysis[cite: 35].
* [cite_start]**Smart Recommendations:** Recommends relevant research papers based on a user’s current topic[cite: 36].
* [cite_start]**Trend Analysis:** Analyzes trends over time for specific keywords or research domains[cite: 37].
* [cite_start]**Collaboration Mapping:** Suggests potential co-authors or institutions based on similar research interests[cite: 38].

## 💻 Technology Stack

* [cite_start]**Core Technologies:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) [cite: 22]
* [cite_start]**Foundation Model:** Mistral.
* **IBM Cloud Services Used:**
    * [cite_start]IBM Cloud Watsonx AI Studio 
    * [cite_start]IBM Cloud Watsonx AI Runtime 
    * [cite_start]IBM Cloud Agent Lab
